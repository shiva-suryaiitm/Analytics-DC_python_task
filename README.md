**Python Tasks:**

- Create two vectors 𝑦 and 𝑦̂ having **the same** dimensions, where 𝑦̂ should
consist of random numbers between [0,1) and 𝑦 should contain 0𝑠 and
1𝑠, for example, 𝑦=[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,...,1]. Compute the given expression:
    
    ![loss](https://github.com/aquantumreality/Coordinator-Task-1/blob/main/cross-entropy.png)
    
    Where n = 100, is the total number of elements in y and 𝑦̂
    
    Note: The expression *O*, which you have computed is actually a
    **Cross-Entropy** loss function used in machine learning for classification
    tasks which tells us how bad or good the model is performing, if *O* is large
    then the model is performing worst and vice versa.
    
- Write a Python class to find a pair of elements (indices of the two
numbers) from a given array whose sum equals a specific target
number.
Note: There will be multiple solutions, so create a dictionary where the
keys represent just [S.No] (1,2,3,4.....) and the value corresponding to
the key represents the indices of the two numbers
    
    For example:
    
    Input: numbers= [10,20,10,40,50,60,70], target=50
    
    Output: {1: [0, 3], 2: [2, 3], 3: [3, 0], 4: [3, 2]}
